# PROJECT PROPOSAL
## Problem & Motivation structured
### Our role: Data scientist team

## Target Audience: - Fire management officer 

Wildfires are increasingly frequent and severe in California, causing massive environmental, economic, and human damage, costing billions and straining emergency resources. Understanding their causes and impacts is critical for developing prevention plans, aiding mitigation efforts, and improving disaster preparedness.  However, analyzing vast datasets is slow, time consuming and complex. This delays decision-making, hinders resource allocation, and limits the effectiveness of prevention and response efforts.
To address this, we propose a Wildfire Data Dashboard that allows Fire Management officers to explore wildfire data interactively. The dashboard will visualize key metrics like area burned, financial losses, and human impact, while enabling users to filter by location, date, and cause. The dashboard also allows export visualizations and summaries for stakeholders and policymakers. 
By identifying trends and hotspots, the dashboard will help allocate resources effectively, reduce wildfire frequency, increase response time and protect communities and ecosystems from the devastating impact of wildfires.
