## **Implemented Features**
- The interactive map is fully integrated, allowing seamless interaction.  
- Clicking a county filters all charts, supporting multi-county selection.  
- The Top 10 Counties by Economic Loss chart replaces the previous Top 5.  
- The Total Economic Loss summary card now renders correctly.  
- Hover-based tooltips show summary stats before filtering.  
- A loading indicator provides real-time feedback during updates.  
- The dashboard layout was improved with:  
  - A structured header, colored section titles, and a gray sidebar.  
  - Filters moved to a sidebar for a cleaner layout.  
  - A "Learn More!" button for additional guidance.  
  - A redesigned Total Economic Loss card for better emphasis.  
- All app files are properly organized.  
- **For Challenging Question**: We added a loading indicator for real-time feedback during updates, improving user experience and preventing confusion about lag. Inspired by Group 17â€™s design:(https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_17_pharma_spend_dashboard).  

## **Features Not Implemented**
- Tooltip summary of hovering on map to include counts based on damage level was not included. Calculating the count was too complex and impacting the performance of the visualization. This was due to data inconsistencies and limitations in Plotly's customization.     

-----------------------------------------------------------
## **Deviations from Proposal**
- Charts were initially non-interactive, requiring manual filtering. Click-based filtering on the map was added for easier selection, including multi-county filtering.  
- The dashboard layout was improved by placing related charts closer together for better readability.  
- A "Learn More" button was added for additional context.  
- The Total Economic Loss summary card was repositioned for better visibility.  
- A loading animation was added to improve user experience.  
- The year slider in the filters section now snaps to specific years.  


-----------------------------------------------------------
## **What the dashboard currently does well**
- Provides a clear visual summary of wildfire impact across California.  
- Supports multi-county comparisons through an interactive map, graphs, and filters.  
- Displays structure and roof type damage trends effectively.  
- Enhances user experience with tooltips, loading indicators, and a structured layout.  
- Allows users to compare wildfire damage by incident or by county.  
- Clearly highlights the most affected structure categories, roof types, and counties.  
- Visualizes economic loss trends, emphasizing financial damage over time.  
- Offers additional insights through the Learn More feature for deeper analysis.  

-----------------------------------------------------------
## **Current Limitations & Future Improvements**

### **Limitations**
- Selecting multiple counties from the map is only possible while holding the "shift" button. Once the map is updated based on your selection, you can only edit your selection using the filter bar or create a new selection on the map.  
- The map tooltip struggled with category-based counts due to data inconsistencies and Plotly limitations.  
 

### **Future Enhancements**
- Refine visuals for better clarity and usability.  
- Improve optimization and interactivity.  
- Add two summary cards to balance the map area.  
- Explore better tooltip implementations for accuracy.
